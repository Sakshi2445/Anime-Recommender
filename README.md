#Anime Recommender

This is an anime Recommender system which works on the basis of two algorithms which are Eucledian Geometry and Cosine Similarity algorithms. 
So basically it uses the vote count, rating and genre to calculate the distance and displays the result while in the cosine similarity it calculates the cosine relation by using the genre of the anime and thus shows up the result.
